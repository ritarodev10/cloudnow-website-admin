# Tailwind and shadcn/ui Guidelines

## Modern Tailwind Setup

- This project does NOT use a traditional `tailwind.config.js` file
- Tailwind configuration is managed through `components.json`
- CSS variables are defined in `src/app/globals.css`
- Use the `@theme inline` directive in globals.css for theme configuration

## shadcn/ui Component Usage

- Import UI components from `@/components/ui/`
- Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils.ts` for conditional class merging
- Component variants are defined in their respective files
- Follow the shadcn/ui naming conventions for props and variants

## CSS Variables

- Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and other design tokens
- Access theme values through the CSS variable system
- Example: `bg-[var(--primary)]` instead of hardcoded colors
- Refer to `globals.css` for the complete list of available variables

## Component Customization

- Extend shadcn/ui components by wrapping them, not modifying source files
- Use composition patterns when building new components
- Maintain consistent styling across custom and shadcn/ui components
